# AIRHOUND Perception - Simulation Testing Requirements
#
# This file contains ONLY the dependencies needed for simulation testing
# with the mock detector (no camera, no YOLO).
#
# Install with:
#   pip install -r requirements-sim.txt
#
# OR for system-wide:
#   pip3 install -r requirements-sim.txt
#
# Note: ROS 2 packages (rclpy, vision_msgs, etc.) are installed via apt,
#       not pip. This file only covers Python packages.

# Required for all modes (numpy is used by mock detector for math operations)
numpy>=1.24,<2.0

# That's it! Mock detector only needs:
# - Standard library (time, math)
# - ROS 2 packages (installed via apt, not pip)
# - NumPy (for random noise generation)
#
# For REAL perception testing, see requirements.txt instead.
